# myPy
myPy captures my personal learning experience with Python. From exploring the
Python language to digging into various frameworks and public modules/packages
leveraged in Python - this repository collects the coding reference and examples
I've used to come up to speed.

In all cases, original work and ownership is cited.

## Learning examples
1. **Microblog** - my code adaptation of the great blog series by Miguel
Grinberg entitled, "[The Flask Mega-Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)"
that I am using to learn the Flask framework. 

2. **md-reporting** - a working set of scripts used to report (csv) metadata used in markdown files.
