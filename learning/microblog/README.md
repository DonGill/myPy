# Learning - microblog
The microblog example is my adaptation of the great blog series by Miguel
Grinberg, "[The Flask Mega-Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)"
that I am using to learn the Flask framework.

## Configuration
This example uses VirtualEnv. 

Will require the steps for setting up VirtualEnv and Flask, prior to it running.
