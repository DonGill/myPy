# Learning - microblog
Microblog - my code adaptation of the great blog series by Miguel
Grinberg entitled, "[The Flask Mega-Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)"
that I am using to learn the Flask framework. 

## Configuration
Configuration for this example assumes that *Python*, *Flask* and *Flask-WTF* are installed in your development environment.
The source example was run using VirtualEnv. I have ommited this requirement for simplicity


## To run the example
To run the microblog example, simply execute the run.py file in the root directory. For example:

```
c:\myPy\learning\microblog> Python run.py
```
